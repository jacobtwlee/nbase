# CPSC 304 Database Project

## Project Description

### Domain

We will model the 2013-2014 NBA league. 

### Domain aspects modeled

We are modelling NBA players that play for Teams, along with NBA Staff that work for Teams. Each Team belongs to a division. Each Team plays a game refereed by an NBA Referee against another Team at a Venue on a particular date. Each Team's Sponsor is also modeled.

User classes include NBA Staff and normal users. Only NBA Staff can modify database information. All other users can only view database information.

### System Functionality

- Search for all NBA Players on a NBA Team.
